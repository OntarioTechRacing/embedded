# DevEnvs

## Overview

Developer environments (dev envs or devenvs), are the tools, platforms, and
settings used for coding. They provide a tailored and efficient workspace that
enhances productivity and supports the specific needs of different development
tasks.

## Conventions

Here are the basic conventions used for quick readability for dev envs.

1. **Required / mandatory items**: `*`.
2. **Industry standard or very helpful**: `(Recommended)`.
    - Please follow recommendations unless you actually know what you are doing.
3. **Opinionated suggestions**: `(Suggested)`.
4. **OS specific**: `only for ...`.
    - If the key phrase above is not included assume the listed dev env software
      works on all major OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
