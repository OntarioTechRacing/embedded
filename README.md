## 1.0 Introduction

👋 **Welcome to the Embedded Software Department Documentation Repository!**

Embedded Software (ES) is the department in charge of regions covering Embedded Systems, Higher level 
programming and rapid systems prototyping.

Our department covers many aspects of engineering, primarily:

- **Mechatronics Engineering** (embedded systems, control systems, electromechanical machines)
- **Electrical Engineering** (circuits, electronics, digital systems, semiconductors)
- **Software Engineering** (version control, algorithms, data structures, networking)
- **Mechanical Engineering** (enclosures, vibrations)
- _And much more!_

Our primary projects fall within **6 main categories**:

1. **Sensors**
   - Collect and forward sensor data
2. **Telemetry**
   - Process, visualize and interpret data
3. **Controls**
   - Control systems, command and manage control loops
4. **Hardware**
   - Design, build and test PCBs and hardware
5. **Interfaces**
   - Design interfaces primarily for driver(s) 
6. **Equipment**
   - Build equipment for testing, simulation, manufacturing, etc

Due to the nature of our department, we also work mostly with the following departments:
- Hardware and Electronics (HE)
  - Designing and building our PCBs, completing the hardware for our projects
- Electric Drivetrain (EDT)
  - Engineering all high voltage and drivetrain aspects of our team 
- Vehicle Dynamics (VD)
  - Data processing for design validation, testing and optimization
