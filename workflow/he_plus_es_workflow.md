# HE + ES Workflow for FSAE Embedded Systems

- By: Mitali G. (HE) + Daniel J. (ES)

The purpose of the HE + ES Workflow is to improve efficiency and accuracy in the embedded systems
development for FSAE.

In general, all boards projects will undergo 2 builds, **Design Validation Testing (DVT) â†’
Production Validation Testing (PVT)**. Between full release builds, the ES team will create
development boards (breadboards, perfboards, etc.)
