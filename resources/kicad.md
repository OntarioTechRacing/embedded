## 2 Libraries

### 2.1 Symbols

The standardized symbol libraries are managed as `.kicad_sym` files.

> See KiCad Docs:
> [Symbols and Symbol Libraries](https://docs.kicad.org/8.0/en/eeschema/eeschema_symbols_and_libraries.html)

### 2.2 Footprints

The standardized footprint libraries are managed as `.pretty` directories.

Individual footprints are saved within the directories as `.kicad_mod` files.

> See KiCad Docs:
> [Footprints and footprint libraries](https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/ru/pcbnew/pcbnew_footprints_and_libraries.html)

### 2.3 3D Models

3D models are directly linked to footprints and saved as `.3dshapes` files.
