## 1.0 Introduction: _What and Why ES?_

👋 **Welcome to the Embedded Software Department Documentation Repository!**

Embedded Software (ES) is the department in charge of regions covering Embedded Systems, Higher level 
programming and rapid systems prototyping.

Our department covers many aspects of engineering, primarily:

- 🤖 **Mechatronics Engineering** (embedded systems, control systems, electromechanical machines)
- ⚡ **Electrical Engineering** (circuits, electronics, digital systems, semiconductors)
- 💻 **Software Engineering** (version control, algorithms, data structures, networking)
- ⚙️ **Mechanical Engineering** (enclosures, vibrations)
- _And much more!_

Our primary projects fall within **6 main categories**:

1. 🔭 **Sensors**
   - Collect and forward sensor data
2. 📈 **Telemetry**
   - Process, visualize and interpret data
3. 🚀 **Controls**
   - Control systems, command and manage control loops
4. ⚡ **Hardware**
   - Design, build, test and integrate PCBs
5. 🎮 **Interfaces**
   - Design interfaces primarily for driver(s) 
6. 🕹️ **Equipment**
   - Build equipment for testing, simulation, manufacturing, etc

Due to the nature of our department, we also work mostly with the following departments:
- **Hardware and Electronics (HE)**
  - Designing and building our PCBs, completing the hardware for our projects
- **Electric Drivetrain (EDT)**
  - Engineering all high voltage and drivetrain aspects of our team 
- **Vehicle Dynamics (VD)**
  - Data processing for design validation, testing and optimization

## 2.0 Conventions, Workflows & Developer Environments: _How We Code_

### Conventions

Conventions are guidelines or standards (usually) agreed-upon for writing code, such as naming, 
formatting, and commenting practices. They are crucial for promoting readability, maintainability, 
and uniformity across a codebase, facilitating easier collaboration and debugging.

All department convention guides can be found in [conventions](conventions).

## 1. Department Templates

- LaTeX Project Requirement Document (PRD) template: [ProjectRequirementDocumentTemplate](conventions%2FProjectRequirementDocumentTemplate)

## 2. Datasheets

- All datasheets are stored on
  the [OTR Embedded Software Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AHPA2ZoOBCtSUk9PVA)

## 3. GitHub Repo Setup

- Templates for `.gitignore` files in [gitignores](gitignores)
- Templates for STM32:
  - [nucleol432kc_template](https://github.com/OntarioTechRacing/nucleol432kc_template)
