# CAD for Mechanical Design

Computer Aided Design (CAD) is used to model and design mechanical parts for our
department.

This is most commonly used later in the design process for enclosures, mounts,
etc.

## Software Installs

### [Siemens NX via OTU Student License](https://software.ontariotechu.ca/software.php?software=nx)* only for Windows

- Simens NX is our primary CAD software, as is with majority, if not all
  departments in OTR.

### [SolidWorks via OTU Student License]() (Recommended) only for Windows

- SolidWorks is used for super specific scenarios where certain features are
  required, however you'll likely need to export `.stl` or `.step`.
